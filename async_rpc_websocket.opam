synopsis: "Library to serve and dispatch Async RPCs over websockets"
description: "
Library to serve and dispatch Async RPCs over websockets.

Rpc_websocket makes it easy to serve and send Async RPCs with
HTTP+Websocket underlying the transport. It also provides a mechanism to share the
RPC implementations between a vanilla TCP server and a HTTP server.

On the server side, the library detects when a websocket connection
is established, and routes to an optionally provided vanilla HTTP handler
when non-websocket traffic occurs.
